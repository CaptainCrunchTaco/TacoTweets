Notes:

Did a silly thing and spent an hour looking for a bug. Turned out I forgot to initialize the client #yep  

Icon deviates from Material Design. Ok with it for now since it seems to draw attention away from other apps. Color scheme however needs to be revisited.  

For future updates:  
- Add "logout" feature  
- Cleanup UI  
- Add more features like reply, favorite, retweet
